## 🧠 Why FocusFlow

Most productivity tools optimize tasks. They don’t optimize the human doing them.

FocusFlow is designed around cognitive energy and flow, helping developers, freelancers and creatives perform at their best without burnout.

The landing page structure follows a product-centric narrative:

1. **Hero — Clear promise**
2. **Problem — Real context**
3. **Why Tools Fail — Strategic comparison**
4. **The System — Framework-driven value**
5. **Social Proof — Credibility**
6. **Results — Emotional transformation**
7. **Final CTA — High-impact conversion**
